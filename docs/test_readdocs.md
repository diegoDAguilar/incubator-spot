# **Apache Spot (Incubating)**   

Apache Spot is open source software for leveraging insights from flow and packet analysis. It helps enterprises and service providers gain insight on their computing environments through transparency of service delivery and identification of potential security threats or attacks happening among resources operating at cloud scale.

While current threat intelligence tools help, identifying unknown threats and attacks remains a challenge. Apache Spot provides tools to accelerate companiesâ€™ ability to expose suspicious connections and previously unseen attacks using flow and packet analysis technologies.
